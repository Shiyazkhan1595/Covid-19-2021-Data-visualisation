📊 COVID-19 Global Dashboard (2021) – Power BI Project

This project showcases an interactive Power BI dashboard built to track global COVID-19 trends using real-world data from 2021. The dashboard allows users to explore confirmed cases, recoveries, and fatalities across countries and time periods with dynamic filters, visuals, and KPIs.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies

Power BI, Power Query, DAX, Excel

🧩 Project Highlights
	•	Data Preparation:
	•	Cleaned and transformed messy data using Power Query (null handling, data types, date standardization).
	•	Merged multiple Excel sheets into a unified data model using a star schema for efficient drill-down analysis.
	•	DAX Calculations:
	•	Created custom measures for daily confirmed cases, 7-day moving averages, recovery and fatality rates.
	•	Applied time intelligence functions for year-over-year and month-over-month comparisons.
	•	Visualizations:
	•	Built interactive visuals: geo maps, line charts, bar charts, KPI cards, slicers, and trend indicators.
	•	Enabled drill-through and tooltip features for deeper data exploration.

🔍 Insights Uncovered
	•	Identified the highest surges by region and time using dynamic date filters.
	•	Analyzed mortality and recovery patterns over time for different continents.
	•	Enabled policymakers and analysts to quickly understand pandemic progression.

🧠 Skills Demonstrated
	•	End-to-end BI workflow: from raw data to clean, insightful dashboards
	•	Practical use of data modeling, ETL, and time-series visualization
	•	Communicating complex datasets to non-technical audiences via intuitive design
